DIVE is a web interface for performing data management, video annotation, and running a portion of the algorithms stored within the [VIAME](https://github.com/VIAME/VIAME) repository. When compiled, docker instances for DIVE can be run either as local servers or online in web services. A sample instance of DIVE is running on a public server at [viame.kitware.com](https://viame.kitware.com).

This is a version of DIVE that integrates with [Digital Slide Archive](https://digitalslidearchive.github.io/digital_slide_archive/).  There are features and differences with the core DIVE functionality.  The [DIVE-DSA user guide](https://DigitalSlideArchive.github.io/dive-dsa/) lists all new features and functionality.

## Features

* video annotation
* still image (and image sequence) annotation
* single-frame boxes, polygons, and lines
* multi-frame bounding box tracks with interpolation
* Automatic transcoding to support most video formats
* Customizable labeling with text, numeric, multiple-choice attributes

## DIVE-DSA Documentation

* [User Guide](https://DigitalSlideArchive.github.io/dive-dsa/)

## Technologies Used

DIVE uses [Girder](https://girder.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for data management and has a typical girder + girder worker + docker architecture.  See docker scripts for additional details.

* The client application is a standard [@vue/cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/) application.
* The job runner is built on celery and [Girder Worker](https://girder-worker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  Command-line executables for VIAME and FFmpeg are built inside the worker docker image.

## Example Data

### Input

DIVE takes two different kinds of input data, either a video file (e.g. .mpg) or an image sequence. Both types can
be optionally accompanied with a CSV file containing video annotations. Example input sequences are available at
https://viame.kitware.com/girder#collections.

### Output

When running an algorithmic pipelines or performing manual video annotation (and saving the annotations with the save
button) output CSV files are produced containing output detections. Simultaneously a detection plot of results
is shown underneath each video sequence.

### Girder Client Web Development

`docker exec -it dive-dsa-girder-1 bash`
`cd /opt/dive/src`
`apt-get update && apt-get install -y npm`
`girder build`
`girder build --dev --watch-plugin dive_server`
